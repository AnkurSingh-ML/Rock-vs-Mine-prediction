# Rock-vs-Mine-prediction
This Python Jupyter Notebook contains a classification problem where the goal is to predict whether an object is a rock or a mine (metallic object) based on sonar data. The dataset used is the Sonar Data, which consists of 60 features that represent the strength of sonar signals bounced off from the object at different angles.
